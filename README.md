## ABOUT

Halloween is nearly approaching and all the superstitions about the dead are being revived again. There is a belief that dead ones may come back to life and interact with the living ones. With this phenomenon they are called undead. In the celebration of Halloween, tales of the undead are being brought up again and for their tale to survive they need to compete. 

## COMPILING & RUNNING

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure Java 8 is installed.
3. Compile the main class using the following command:

    ```bash
    javac src/Main.java -d bin -cp src
    ```

  This will create a `Main.class` file in the `bin` directory, and all the classes that it uses.

4. Run the main class from the current directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

5. Alternatively, just double click the `run.bat` file in the current directory which would automatically run these two commands for you.

## USAGE

Having been inspired by how users interact with bots in Discord, this game is played by typing prefixed commands into the terminal.

(todo: add list of commands)
