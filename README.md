## Welcome to Undead Game!

## ABOUT

This is a game about the undead--zombies and stuff.

## INSTALLATION

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure Java 8 is installed.
3. Compile the main class using the following command:

    ```bash
    javac src/Main.java -d bin -cp src
    ```

  This will create a `Main.class` file in the `bin` directory, and all the classes that it uses.

4. Run the main class from the current directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

## USAGE

Having been inspired by how users interact with bots in Discord, this game is played by typing prefixed commands into the terminal.
